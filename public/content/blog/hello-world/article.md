Greetings! I’m a game developer from Slovenia. I go by the name Danijel and I do freelance programming for a living. I’m a retro game enthusiast, always figuring out ways to express my desire for all things pixelated. This is my little corner of the web where I post various tech- and programming-related things, as well as other completely random things that may interest me at the time.

Enjoy your stay! <span class="smol">\*rocket jumps out of sight\*</span>
