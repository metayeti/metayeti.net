AI is useful - sometimes. There's no denying that.

Unfortunately, it's also dumb:

Worse yet, it makes *you* dumb:  
[AI Tools in Society: Impacts on Cognitive Offloading and the Future of Critical Thinking](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6)
 
It likes to exploits our psychology:

And it decays our existing skills:

So, use it sparingly I guess.

On a positive note, the tech itself is very interesting:
