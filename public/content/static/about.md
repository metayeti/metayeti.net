# Skills

## Programming

I started programming at an early age of about 10. The very first thing I remember is trying to figure out how timers work in [Visual Basic 3](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/30). Later on, I weaved my way through VB5 and 6, then C, Pascal, and finally C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript and many others.

<p class="caption">Visual Basic 3 - my earliest programming memory.</p>

Throughout my programming journey, I've explored a wide range of technologies, methodologies, frameworks, computer science concepts, mathematics, and related fields.

My favorite programming language is C++ with its raw power, expressivity and rock-like stability. My second favorite programming language is JavaScript. It's moderately high level but remains eloquent in its simplicity, yet highly expressive.

I like [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). You can check out some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/metayeti).

## Human languages

As an aspiring member of the human species, I've learned some human languages.

- Slovenian, my mother tongue. As perplexing as it is beautiful.
- Serbo-Croatian, my 2nd language, I rarely use it but I understand it more or less flawlessly.
- English, my 3rd language. I would rate my level as advanced.

<p class="fancy-block">My attempts to learn German have been less than fruitful so far, although Duolingo had successfully trained me to be able to ask for the whereabout of horses, should I ever encounter a situation in which that would become a pressing concern. My attempts to learn Russian have been similar, and I assure you I'm capable of asking for the whereabouts of horses in Russian as well. I'm now trying to learn Japanese. I have not learned how to ask for the whereabouts of horses in Japanese just yet, but I expect to be able to discuss it fluently soon.</p>

## Art & Music

I've been interested in all manners of visual design ever since I can remember. In the very early days I used to make interfaces in Visual Basic just for fun. In recent times I mostly work with web interfaces.

I have always been interested in art and music. I tried to learn the guitar at an early age (and persisted for quite a while). I've been interested in drawing since I can remember, although it's only the last decade or so when I took it upon myself to get good enough at it to be able to use it for higher goals. For games, I decided to focus mostly on pixel art as that's my favorite graphical style (no doubt inspired by the games I used to play).

I've getting better at composing my own game music. You can listen to some of my music on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/metayeti).
